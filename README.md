Backend

    Runtime & Framework:
        Node.js with Express:
            Fast, lightweight, and widely supported.
            Perfect for building RESTful APIs.
    Real-Time Communication:
        Socket.IO:
            Easily integrate real-time updates and notifications.
    Authentication:
        JWT (JSON Web Tokens):
            Implement secure user authentication without extra cost.
    Database Integration:
        MongoDB:
            Use MongoDB Atlas’s free tier for a hosted solution, or run a local instance during development.
            Use Mongoose as the ODM for modeling your data.

Frontend

    Framework:
        React:
            Use Create React App to quickly set up your project.
            Build an engaging, dynamic user interface.
    Routing & State Management:
        React Router:
            Manage navigation between pages (e.g., home, profile, feed).
        (Optional) Redux or Context API:
            Manage complex state if your app scales.
    Styling:
        CSS Frameworks:
            Use Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for pre-built styling components.
    Real-Time Updates:
        Socket.IO Client:
            Integrate with your backend Socket.IO setup to display live updates.

Deployment & Version Control

    Code Hosting:
        GitHub:
            Host your code, collaborate, and use Git for version control.
    Deployment:
        Backend:
            Deploy on Heroku (free tier) or similar platforms like Render.
        Frontend:
            Deploy on Vercel or GitHub Pages for a free, seamless experience.

Additional Tools

    API Testing:
        Postman or Insomnia:
            Test your API endpoints without incurring any cost.
    Local Development:
        Visual Studio Code:
            Free, feature-rich code editor with great extensions for Node.js and React.
